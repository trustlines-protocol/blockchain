# Developer Documentation

## Branches

We use `bridge/pre-release` for release candidates and
`bridge/release` for releases. We only merge from master to
`bridge/pre-release` and from `bridge/pre-release` to
`bridge/release`.
We never merge back to the `master` branch.

The version on the master branch should always be a `dev` version, on
`bridge/pre-release` we should only have `rc` releases and on
`bridge/release` the we only have 'prod' releases (where `prod`
doesn't appear in the version number, i.e. the version number is
always major.minor.patch)

## bumpversion

`tools/bridge` uses [bumpversion](https://pypi.org/project/bumpversion/) in order
to maintain it's version. bumpversion can be used to automatically upgrade the version
in multiple files. The file `VERSION` contains the current version,
it's also maintained in `bridge/version.py` and `setup.cfg`.

bumpversion is configured via the `tools/bridge/.bumpversion.cfg`
configuration file. If you want to run bumpversion to change the
bridge's version, please change to the `tools/bridge` directory first.

## Making a pre-release

Checkout the `bridge/pre-release` branch:

```
git checkout bridge/pre-release
git pull
git merge -m 'Merge with master branch' origin/master
cd tools/bridge
bumpversion release
```

and open a PR for that branch.

The version in the `bridge/pre-release` branch should always be a
'release candidate' version with the `rc` suffix.

## Making a release

Run the following commands:

```
git checkout bridge/release
git pull
git merge -m 'Merge with pre-release branch' origin/bridge/pre-release
bumpversion release
```

and open a PR for that branch.

After a release has been made, we should upgrade the version on the
master branch with `bumpversion patch`.

## Release Checklist

0. Prerequisite: The master branch contains the version to be
   released
1. Create a new branch `bridge/prepare/pre-release-<version>` based
   on `bridge/pre-release` and merge the `master` branch into it.
   Bump the version with
   `bumpversion release`.
   Verify that the version is a release candidate (e.g. `v0.1.1.rc0`).
   Now open a PR to `bridge/pre-release`.
   Merging this will build the docker image and push it to Docker
   Hub under `trustlines/bridge-next:pre-release`.
2. Test the pre-release:
   - Pull the newly built image from Docker Hub.
   - Run the bridge worker and connected to a home and foreign chain
     node without any pre-existing state and check that it does not
     crash and starts to sync properly.
   - Run the bridge worker in a pre-existing environment set up using
     the quickstart script and check that it does not crash and
     starts to sync properly.
   - Perform any additional tests compelled by the specifics of the
     update.
3. Create a new branch `bridge/prepare/release-<version>` based on
   `bridge/release` and merge `bridge/pre-release` into it.
   Bump the version with
   `bumpversion release`
   and verify that the version is a release (e.g. `v0.1.1`).
   Now open a PR to `bridge/release`, wait for a
   review confirming that the necessary testing steps have been
   performed, and merge it.
4. Authorize the release in CircleCI
5. Check that the image is built and pushed to Docker Hub under
   `trustlines/bridge:release`.
6. Merge the bridge/release branch back into master and use
   bumpversion in order to make sure the master branch only contains
   '-dev' versions.
