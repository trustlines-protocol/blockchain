# NAME
#   Client Wrapper
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   client_wrapper.sh [-r] [role] [-a] [address] [-c] [arguments]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   A wrapper for the actual client to make the Docker image easy to use by preparing the client for
#   a set of predefined list of roles the client can take without having to write lines of arguments on run Docker.
#
# OPTIONS
#   -r [--role]         Role the client should use.
#                       Depending on the chosen role the client gets prepared for that role.
#                       Selecting a specific role can require further arguments.
#                       Checkout ROLES for further information.
#
#   -a [--address]      The Ethereum address that the client should use.
#                       Depending on the chosen role, the address gets inserted at the right
#                       place of the configuration, so the client is aware of it.
#                       Gets ignored if not necessary for the chosen role.
#
#   -c [--client-args]  Additional arguments that should be forwarded to the client.
#                       Make sure this is the last argument, because everything after is
#                       forwarded.
#   -p [--parity-args]  Same as client-args, only exists for backwards compatibility
#                       [DEPRECATED]
#
# ROLES
#   The list of available roles is:
#
#   observer
#     - Is the default role
#     - Does only watch for propagated blocks.
#     - Non arguments required at all.
#
#   participant
#     - Connects to an account to being able to create transactions.
#     - Requires the address argument.
#     - Needs the password file and the key-set. (see FILES)
#
#   validator
#     - Connect as authority to the network for validating blocks.
#     - Requires the address argument.
#     - Needs the password file and the key-set. (see FILES)
#
# FILES
#   The configuration folder for used client takes place at /home/openethereum/.local/share/openethereum.
#   Alternately the shorthand symbolic link at /config can be used.
#   Openethereum's data base is at /home/openethereum/.local/share/openethereum/chains or available trough /data as well.
#   To provide custom files in addition bind a volume through Docker to the sub-folder called 'custom'.
#   The password file is expected to be placed in the custom configuration folder names 'pass.pwd'.
#   The key-set is expected to to be placed in the custom configuration folder under 'keys/Trustlines/'
#   Besides from using the pre-defined locations, it is possible to define them manually thought the client
#   arguments. Checkout their documentation to do so.
